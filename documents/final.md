## Final project essay

**1) Now that you have seen many full research projects saved online as GitHub repositories do you plan to use GitHub for your future projects as a way to store code and data in the cloud and to share your progress with others?**

-----
Yes. Github is a great way to organize your code and make it available to the scientific community.

-----

**2) Did you project accomplish the goals that you set out for yourself in your proposal? If not, why? What was the hardest problem in your project that were able to overcome? What, if any, was a problem that you were unable to overcome in your project within the given time?**

-----
No, unfortunately, I realized my project was overly ambitious for the timeframe I had to develop it. However, I managed to complete one step of the pipeline for a single sample. I believe that once I accomplish the simplest tasks (e.g., making the entire pipeline run for a single sample) I can more easily add additional code. The hardest problem I was able to overcome was to understand and successfully recycle ipyrad code. I was happy to be able to integrate all function and objects across different scripts, parsed commands and param files. I had an enormous issue, however, when dealing with the binary files of programs. First, it was really hard to tell the program the path to the binaries and how to run them across platforms and permission profiles. That was the one issue that prevented me from moving on.

**3) Do you feel that you've learned the skills necessary perform data analysis in Python, and to write your own program or pipeline for data analysis? What skills do you think you need to work on further, and where would you look to find more information about learning these skills?**

-----
Yes, I feel that I am way more qualified to write and read python code now than I was before taking the class. Moving forward with this project, I will probably reach for help on Google and to my fellow python expert friends (aka Isaac Overcast).
